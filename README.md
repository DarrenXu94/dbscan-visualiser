# DBScan Visualiser

## Visualisations of the DBScan algorithm with points displayed on a canvas.

DBSCAN is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density. Given that DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm, it does a great job of seeking areas in the data that have a high density of observations, versus areas of the data that are not very dense with observations.
